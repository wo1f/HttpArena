# Profile format: "pipeline|req_per_conn|cpu_limit|connections|endpoint"
#   pipeline      — gcannon -p value (1 for non-pipelined)
#   req_per_conn  — gcannon -r value (0 = unlimited)
#   cpu_limit     — container cpuset (e.g. "0-31,64-95") or cpu count
#   connections   — comma-separated list; each value is a separate run
#   endpoint      — dispatch key; tells the driver which tool + shape to use
#
# Adding a profile: add a line to PROFILES and append to PROFILE_ORDER.

    # Async: GET /delay/15, a flat 15ms wait. Held connections (req_per_conn=0)
    # so every one of them is a pending timer the server has to carry.
    #
    # History, since the delay is the knob everything else hangs off:
    #   10-30ms draw, 32768/49152c  ceiling 1.64M/2.46M, tokio at 93%/83%
    #   flat 10ms,    64000c        ceiling 6.4M,        tokio 2240622 (35%)
    #   flat 15ms,    64000c        ceiling 4.27M
    # tokio gained 10% for a ceiling that had more than doubled, which is what
    # capacity-bound looks like — the delay stopped being the limiter at 10ms.
    #
    # Which is why 15 and not 5. The delay cuts both ways: an async server is
    # capped at conns/delay, a blocking one at threads/delay, so shortening it
    # frees a blocked thread sooner and narrows the gap this profile exists to
    # show. At 15ms a 64-thread blocking server tops out at 4267 rps against
    # tokio's measured 2.24M. It also leaves the 3-4ms a sloppy timer costs at
    # about a quarter of the wait rather than most of it.
    #
    # 4.27M sits just under the ~4.4M baseline peak, which puts the ceiling back
    # in play as a correctness check: nothing can beat conns/delay while
    # honouring the delay, so a result above it did not wait.
    #
    # 64000 rather than 65536: system_tune() widens ip_local_port_range to
    # 1024-65535 and gcannon needs one ephemeral port per connection, so 64505
    # are usable after ip_local_reserved_ports. 65536 connections to one
    # localhost:8080 cannot be established at all — the whole 16-bit port space
    # is smaller than that. 64000 fits with ~500 ports to spare; if the ramp
    # ever shows up as connect errors, 61440 is the next stop down.

    # Latency-1M: the offered rate is pinned at 1M req/s (see ZRK_FIXED_RATE
    # in tools/zrk.sh) and the measurement is what the server spent to serve
    # it, read exactly out of the container's cgroup rather than sampled.
    #
    # Every other profile here asks how fast a server can go. Real servers
    # spend almost all of their time nowhere near that, so this asks the
    # question from the other end: at a load everybody can carry, who carries
    # it cheaply. 1024 connections because the socket count is part of the
    # workload — 500K req/s needs only ~15 in flight, so the rest of them are
    # there to be polled, which is exactly the cost being compared.

    # duration -- the rate is the only variable, which is what makes the two
    # numbers comparable.
    #
    # Where latency-1m asks what a server costs at a load only the fastest
    # entries carry, this asks what it costs while nearly idle, which is where
    # most services actually sit. At 10K req/s across 64 threads the work is
    # negligible, so what is left in the CPU figure is the standing cost:
    # poll loops, timers, background GC, wakeups. A busy box amortises those
    # away; this one does not.

    # 100 KB rather than more: in+out is 200 KB per request, so the box's
